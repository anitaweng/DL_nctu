# DNN & CNN classifier
```
1. For problem 1, implementing DNN and back propagation by myself without any tools.
   This work classfies MNIST dataset for number 0~9.
   The details of this dataset can be referred to: https://github.com/bat67/TibetanMNIST.
   Use train.npz as training data and test.npz as test data.
   The related files are named after hw1_q1*.py
```
```
2. For problem 2, implementing CNN.
   This work recognizes wearing mask good/none/bad.
   The original dataset comes from Eden Social Welfare Foundation.
   The related files are named after hw1_q2*.py
   Run preprocess.py first to preprocess the training and testing images.
