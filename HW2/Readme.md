# RNN & VAE
```
1. For problem 1, implementing RNN for COVID-19 trend predicton.

```
2. For problem 2, implementing Variational Autoencoder for image reconstruction.
   The related files are named after hw2_q2*.py
   Run preprocess.py first for image preprocessing.
   test_sample.py and interpolation.py are for testing.
   The demonstrated results are shown as below:
